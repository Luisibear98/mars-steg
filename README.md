# mars-steg

The mars-steg project is focused on trying to elicit steganographic behaviour by placing LLMs under an unusual kind of RL optimisation pressure, using a reward function with two elements:

1. A reward for successfully completing a task;
2. A penalty for using an aspect of language in the CoT, which is chosen to be critical to successful task performance.

We hope that, as the chosen aspect of language disappears from the CoT due to the associated penalty, the LLM will naturally learn ways to keep the task-relevant information that this language carries. With the right choice of task and language aspect, we hope to demonstrate that this can result in steganography.

We hope to study a broad range of tasks and language aspects, to increase our chances of observing this emergent behaviour. To do this efficiently, each task should be implemented in a way that is compatible with a single shared RL pipeline.
